        Its your graduation and I‚Äôm excited that i have the opportunity to make it a memorable day for you. 
        When we met in 200 level, I was going to write you off as one of them play boys. Ayomide you proved to me that our friendship was more than that. In your little way, you tried to make sure I was doing good academically and mentally too. 
        In our 400 level when everyone had gone far with their projects and I hadn‚Äôt even done much, you made it a duty of yours to help me. Not sure you remember but you actually dedicated a day to review what I had done , check for plagiarism (first time I actually knew there was a site to check that) and gave me materials to help me forge forward. 
        You‚Äôve been a sweet teddy bear of a friend. You are indeed a true friend who desires the best for people around him, so being able to celebrate your wins, is defo a honor. 
        Happy graduation to you love, greater heights than this, more money to your pocket and fame to your name. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è`,

        It‚Äôs good to have him in my corner even if we don‚Äôt talk that much. My friendship with him has gone through various phases, like literally different phases. But I love what he stands for and how he would go out for people. Couldn‚Äôt be more proud of him bagging the degree. It‚Äôs better days ahead for you bro and the sky is just the beginning. Keep winning.
