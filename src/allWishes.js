        I know we don’t talk often as much as it should be but you’re always on my mind. You’re a good friend with a pure heart, you look out for the ones you really care about and I really like that about you.
        I remember when the journey started from you gaining admission and relocating to the UK. You really worked hard and now you deserve to be celebrated. Congratulations Ayo, you’ve made me and everyone else proud🤗. This definitely wouldn’t be the last time I get to brag about you 🏆❤️`,

        Its your graduation and I’m excited that i have the opportunity to make it a memorable day for you. 
        When we met in 200 level, I was going to write you off as one of them play boys. Ayomide you proved to me that our friendship was more than that. In your little way, you tried to make sure I was doing good academically and mentally too. 
        In our 400 level when everyone had gone far with their projects and I hadn’t even done much, you made it a duty of yours to help me. Not sure you remember but you actually dedicated a day to review what I had done , check for plagiarism (first time I actually knew there was a site to check that) and gave me materials to help me forge forward. 
        You’ve been a sweet teddy bear of a friend. You are indeed a true friend who desires the best for people around him, so being able to celebrate your wins, is defo a honor. 
        Happy graduation to you love, greater heights than this, more money to your pocket and fame to your name. ❤️❤️❤️`,

        It’s good to have him in my corner even if we don’t talk that much. My friendship with him has gone through various phases, like literally different phases. But I love what he stands for and how he would go out for people. Couldn’t be more proud of him bagging the degree. It’s better days ahead for you bro and the sky is just the beginning. Keep winning.

How we became friends just cus a mutual friend of ours told you she had a friend coming to Babcock, you took it upon yourself to find me and continuously checked up on me, that marked the beginning of our friendship. How we always dedicated one “dorcasing” night to ourselves just to catch up and check in on ourselves. How this made my boyfriend at the time jealous😂😂
        Let’s also not forget how annoying you can be… lol. No one fights as much as we do, but we always find a way to stay friends ( I think we’re fighting presently sef, but we go still settle am). I might not say this often but I cherish and appreciate our friendship a lot . 
        You’re so selfless, how you always put others even before yourself, always there when needed. I’m so blessed to have you in my corner. I’m super proud of you and excited for this new phase you’re about to embark on. I wish you success, more money and lots more money ( so I can bill you 😏).
